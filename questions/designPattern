Design Patterns for PHP Senior Developer Interviews
Singleton Pattern

Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Use Case: Database connection management.

Factory Pattern

Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

Use Case: Creating different types of payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).

Dependency Injection (DI)

Passes dependencies into a class rather than having the class create them.

Use Case: Injecting a database service into a controller in Laravel/Symfony.

Observer Pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

Use Case: Event handling, such as notifying users when an order status changes.

Decorator Pattern

Adds behavior to objects dynamically without modifying their code.

Use Case: Adding logging or caching to an existing service.

Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

Use Case: Switching between different sorting algorithms.

Repository Pattern

Separates business logic from data access logic by providing a collection-like interface to entities.

Use Case: Abstracting database queries in a CRUD application.

Adapter Pattern

Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping one in a compatible interface.

Use Case: Integrating a third-party API with your applicationâ€™s interface.

Facade Pattern

Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Use Case: Simplifying interaction with a multi-step order processing system.

MVC (Model-View-Controller)

Separates application logic into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic).

Use Case: Building a web application with frameworks like Laravel or Symfony.
