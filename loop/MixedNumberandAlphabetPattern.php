Time Complexity Analysis:
O(n^2) where n is the number of rows
- The main loop runs n times
- For each row i, we have 3 inner loops that run up to i times
- Though the inner loops have break statements, in worst case they still contribute to quadratic complexity

Space Complexity: O(1)
- Only using a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size
- Variables like $rows, $num, $i, $j, $k use constant space
- No additional data structures are used that grow with input

Detailed explanation:

1. First loop (i): Controls number of rows
   - Runs from 1 to $rows (n times)

2. For each row:
   a) First condition checks if row is 1 or 3
      - O(1) operation
   
   b) First inner loop (k)
      - Prints letter based on ASCII (A + num)
      - Has break, so O(1) per row
   
   c) Second inner loop (j)
      - Prints number
      - Has break, so O(1) per row
   
   d) Third inner loop (k)
      - Prints another letter
      - Has break, so O(1) per row

The pattern builds symmetrically:
Row 1: 1
Row 2: A2A
Row 3: 1B3B1
Row 4: A2C4C2A

Each row follows pattern:
- Alternates between numbers and letters
- Is palindromic (same forward and backward)
- Letters increment (A->B->C->D)
- Numbers increment by position
